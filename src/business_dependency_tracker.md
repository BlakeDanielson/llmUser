# Business Innovation Dependency Tracker

## Overview
This tracker documents dependencies between various business innovation factors within the BRCT framework. Unlike code dependencies, business dependencies represent relationships between market factors, organizational capabilities, customer needs, and other business elements that influence innovation outcomes.

## Dependency Types and Symbols

| Symbol | Type | Description |
|--------|------|-------------|
| `M` | Market | Dependency on market conditions or customer factors |
| `O` | Organizational | Dependency on internal capabilities or resources |
| `T` | Technological | Dependency on technological factors or capabilities |
| `F` | Financial | Dependency on funding, investment, or financial metrics |
| `R` | Regulatory | Dependency on legal or regulatory factors |
| `C` | Competitive | Dependency on competitor actions or positioning |
| `S` | Strategic | Dependency on strategic decisions or direction |
| `<` | Input | The row depends on the column as an input |
| `>` | Output | The column depends on the row as an input |
| `x` | Bidirectional | Mutual dependency between factors |
| `o` | Self | No dependency (diagonal elements only) |
| `n` | None | Verified no dependency |
| `p` | Placeholder | Unverified potential dependency |

## Usage Instructions
1. Define business factors in the Key Definitions section
2. Use the grid to track dependencies between factors
3. Replace placeholder 'p' values with appropriate dependency types as analysis proceeds
4. Document detailed dependency relationships in the Notes section

## Recursive Dependency Analysis

For detailed dependencies within each major category, create separate mini-dependency trackers focused on specific components of each category. For example:

- Market Factor Mini-Tracker: Dependencies between different customer segments
- Product Factor Mini-Tracker: Dependencies between product features
- Financial Factor Mini-Tracker: Dependencies between revenue and cost elements

## Usage in BRCT Framework

This dependency tracker should be used during:

1. **Idea Generation**: To understand how different business factors influence potential innovations
2. **Idea Evaluation**: To assess dependencies that might affect the feasibility of an innovation
3. **Strategy Development**: To identify critical dependencies that must be addressed in the implementation plan
4. **Execution Planning**: To sequence activities based on dependency relationships

Update this tracker as new dependencies are discovered during the innovation process. When complex dependencies emerge within a specific area, create a mini-tracker to document detailed relationships.
