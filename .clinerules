[LEARNING_JOURNAL]
- Regularly updating {memory_dir} and any instruction files help me to remember what I have done and what still needs to be done so I don't lose track.
- Ensure functions handle potential `None` inputs gracefully to prevent TypeErrors.
- Verify function call arguments match definitions precisely after refactoring.
- `analyze-project` implicitly handles key regeneration and tracker updates.
- Large context windows can cause `write_to_file` to truncate; prefer `apply_diff` for targeted changes.
- Verify data structures passed between functions (e.g., list vs. dict vs. float) when debugging TypeErrors.
- Check file writing logic carefully (overwrite vs. append vs. reconstruction in buffer) when investigating duplication bugs in tracker files. Ensure write mode ('w') fully overwrites.
- Carefully respect the ground truth definitions for dependency characters when adding/changing dependencies.
- When using `apply_diff`, the SEARCH block must match the current file content exactly, without any +/- markers from previous diff attempts. Use `read_file` to confirm content if unsure.
- Web application subscription models require careful balance between pricing and backend API costs to maintain profitability.
- LLM provider landscapes change rapidly; architecture should allow for easy addition/removal of providers.
- Performance optimization is both a technical challenge and a key differentiator for web-based LLM interfaces.
- API dependency represents both the core value proposition and the greatest vulnerability for multi-model access services.
- Technical professionals show higher immediate willingness to pay for optimized LLM experiences than non-technical users.
- Adapter pattern is essential for managing multiple LLM provider integrations and insulating the system from API changes.
- Edge computing architecture can significantly reduce time-to-first-token in LLM responses.
- Secure API key management is critical for both system security and maintaining provider relationships.
- MongoDB provides the flexibility needed for varying conversation and user data structures in LLM applications.

**IMPORTANT**
1. Understand the Objective: Clearly define the goal of the current step.
2. Analyze the Error: Understand the error message and its context.
3. Formulate a Plan: Develop a plan to address the error, step-by-step.
    *Consider all related aspects* (e.g. files, modules, dependencies, etc.)
4. Execute the Plan (Tool Use): Use the appropriate tool to execute *one* step of the plan.
5. Validate the Result: Check if the tool use was successful and if it addressed the error.
6. Iterate: If the error persists, go back to step 2 and refine the plan based on the new information.
