# **Business Recursive Chain-of-Thought Framework (BRCT) - Strategy Plugin v1.1**

**This Plugin provides detailed instructions and procedures for the Strategy phase of the BRCT system. It should be used in conjunction with the Core System Prompt.**

---

## I. Entering and Exiting Strategy Phase

**Entering Strategy Phase:**
1.  **`.clinerules` Check**: Always read `.clinerules` first. If `[LAST_ACTION_STATE]` shows `current_phase: "Strategy"`, proceed with these instructions.
2.  **Transition from Set-up/Maintenance**: Enter after Set-up/Maintenance; `.clinerules` `next_phase` will be "Strategy".
3.  **User Trigger**: Start a new session after Set-up/Maintenance or to resume strategy.

**Exiting Strategy Phase:**
1.  **Completion Criteria:**
    -   Business ideas have been generated and evaluated.
    -   Business models have been developed for selected ideas.
    -   Strategic analyses (SWOT, market research) have been completed.
    -   Key implementation tasks derived from the strategy are identified and prioritized.
    -   Instruction files (e.g., in `strategy_tasks/` or using HDTA format) for prioritized tasks are created with objectives, context, and steps defined.
2.  **`.clinerules` Update (MUP):**
    ```
    last_action: "Completed Strategy Phase - Business Plan & Tasks Developed"
    current_phase: "Strategy"
    next_action: "Phase Complete - User Action Required"
    next_phase: "Execution"
    ```
3.  **User Action**: After updating `.clinerules`, pause for user to trigger Execution phase via a new session. See Core System Prompt, Section III for a phase transition checklist.

## II. Loading Context for Strategy

**Action**: Load context to guide business innovation strategy.
**Procedure:**
-   Load core files: `.clinerules`, `projectbrief.md`, `userProfile.md`, `activeContext.md`, `src/business_dependency_tracker.md`, `changelog.md`, `progress.md`.
-   *If using CRCT script:* Load `module_relationship_tracker.md`, `doc_tracker.md`.
-   *If using HDTA:* Load `system_manifest.md`.
-   Review `activeContext.md` for current state, decisions, and priorities.
-   Check `src/business_dependency_tracker.md` (and script trackers if used) for relevant dependencies.
-   Revisit `projectbrief.md` to align with business goals.
-   Examine `.clinerules` [LEARNING_JOURNAL] for past insights.
-   Review available business templates in `src/business_templates/`.

## III. Business Idea Generation

**Action**: Generate business ideas using structured approaches and templates.
**Procedure:**
1.  **Select Approach**: Choose methodology (Brainstorming, Mind Mapping, Design Thinking, etc.).
2.  **Use Idea Generation Template**: Utilize `src/business_templates/idea_generation_template.md` to document:
    -   Business challenge, target users, current solutions.
    -   Brainstorming process, participants, techniques.
    -   Recursive decomposition of the problem.
    -   Raw ideas generated, refined top ideas.
3.  **Apply Business Chain-of-Thought**: Document reasoning, considered factors, insights, alternatives.
4.  **MUP**: Follow Core MUP and Section VIII additions.

---

## IV. Business Idea Evaluation

**Action**: Evaluate generated business ideas using structured criteria.
**Procedure:**
1.  **Use Idea Evaluation Template**: Utilize `src/business_templates/idea_evaluation_template.md` for each promising idea:
    -   Summarize idea (name, description, problem).
    -   Assess desirability, feasibility, viability, strategic alignment.
    -   Perform SWOT analysis for the idea.
    -   Assess risks and mitigation.
2.  **Apply Recursive Decomposition**: Evaluate key components of the idea.
3.  **Document Chain-of-Thought**: Record insights, reasoning, decision rationale.
4.  **Make Recommendation**: Proceed, modify, or reject; prioritize selected ideas; define next steps.
5.  **MUP**: Follow Core MUP and Section VIII additions.

---

## V. Business Model Development

**Action**: Develop business models for selected ideas.
**Procedure:**
1.  **Use Business Model Canvas Template**: Utilize `src/business_templates/business_model_canvas.md`:
    -   Define customer segments, value propositions, channels, relationships, revenue streams, key resources, activities, partnerships, cost structure. Apply recursive analysis where helpful.
2.  **Analyze Model Coherence**: Check fit, consistency, competitive comparison.
3.  **Document Chain-of-Thought**: Record insights, dependencies, differentiators.
4.  **Define Validation Plan**: List key assumptions to test in Execution, define methods, set success criteria.
5.  **MUP**: Follow Core MUP and Section VIII additions.

---

## VI. Strategic Analysis

**Action**: Perform comprehensive strategic analyses to inform business innovation.
**Procedure:**
1.  **SWOT Analysis**:
    -   Use `src/business_templates/swot_analysis_template.md`.
    -   Analyze internal strengths/weaknesses, external opportunities/threats.
    -   Apply recursive decomposition. Analyze cross-dependencies. Develop strategic implications.
2.  **Market Research**:
    -   Use `src/business_templates/market_research_template.md`.
    -   Define objectives. Analyze market overview, segments, trends. Perform competitive analysis. Develop personas/journeys. Apply recursive analysis. Document methodology.
3.  **Dependency Analysis**:
    -   Update `src/business_dependency_tracker.md` (and script trackers if used) with new insights. Refine relationships.
4.  **MUP**: Follow Core MUP and Section VIII additions.

---

## VII. Creating Implementation Task Instructions

**Action**: Create structured instruction files for prioritized tasks identified during strategy.

**Procedure:**
1.  **Identify Key Tasks**: Based on evaluated ideas, business models, and strategic analysis, identify the key tasks needed for the Execution phase (e.g., market validation, prototype development, operational setup).
2.  **Prioritize Tasks**:
    -   Review tasks identified.
    -   Assess dependencies (using `src/business_dependency_tracker.md` or script commands like `show-dependencies`).
    -   Consider project goals (`projectbrief.md`) and current state (`activeContext.md`).
    -   Update `activeContext.md` with prioritized task list and reasoning.
3.  **Choose Instruction Format & Location:**
    -   **Option A (Simple)**: Create `{task_name}_instructions.md` in `strategy_tasks/`. Use clear names.
    -   **Option B (HDTA)**: Create HDTA documents (`implementation_plan_{...}.md`, `{task_name}.md`) potentially within module directories, following CRCT templates if desired. Manually link these within the HDTA structure (e.g., link Task Instructions to Implementation Plans).
4.  **Populate Instruction File Sections (Adapt based on chosen format):**
    -   Set title: `# {Task Name} Instructions`
    -   Define **Objective**: Clear purpose and goals.
    -   Provide **Context**: Background, constraints, links to relevant strategy documents (e.g., evaluation, BMC).
    -   List **Dependencies**: Reference business factors, other tasks, required resources/information.
    -   Outline **Steps**: Break into actionable increments for the Execution phase.
    -   Specify **Expected Output**: Describe deliverables.
    -   Add **Notes**: Challenges, considerations, links.
    -   Example (Simple Format):
        ```
        # Market Validation Task Instructions

        ## Objective
        Validate assumptions about target market segment and value proposition via customer interviews.

        ## Context
        Derived from Business Model Canvas v1 and Idea Evaluation for 'Project X'. Key assumptions: customer willingness to pay, problem severity.

        ## Dependencies
        - Business Factors: Target Customer Segment definition, Value Proposition details.
        - Resources: Access to potential customer contacts.

        ## Steps
        1. Develop customer interview script focusing on problem validation and willingness to pay.
        2. Identify and schedule 10-15 interviews with target customer profile.
        3. Conduct interviews using the script, focusing on open-ended questions.
        4. Synthesize feedback, identifying patterns related to assumptions.
        5. Document findings and update relevant sections of BMC and Idea Evaluation.

        ## Expected Output
        - Finalized interview script.
        - Interview notes/summaries.
        - Report summarizing findings on key assumptions.
        - Updated BMC and Idea Evaluation documents.

        ## Notes
        - Seek disconfirming evidence during interviews.
        - Schedule buffer time between interviews for note-taking.
        ```
5.  **Pre-Action Verification (for file creation):** Check if instruction file already exists to avoid overwrites unless intended.
6.  **MUP**: Follow Core MUP and Section VIII additions after creating/updating instruction files.
