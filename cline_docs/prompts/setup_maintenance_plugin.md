# **Business Recursive Chain-of-Thought Framework (BRCT) - Set-up/Maintenance Plugin**

**This Plugin provides detailed instructions and procedures for the Set-up/Maintenance phase of the BRCT system. It should be used in conjunction with the Core System Prompt.**

---

## I. Entering and Exiting Set-up/Maintenance Phase

**Entering Set-up/Maintenance Phase:**
1. **Initial State**: Start here for new projects or if `.clinerules` shows `current_phase: "Set-up/Maintenance"`.
2. **`.clinerules` Check**: Always read `.clinerules` first. If `[LAST_ACTION_STATE]` indicates "Set-up/Maintenance", proceed with these instructions.
3. **New Project**: If `.clinerules` is missing/empty, assume this phase and initialize core files.

**Exiting Set-up/Maintenance Phase:**
1. **Completion Criteria:**
   - All core files exist and are initialized.
   - `business_dependency_tracker.md` is populated with business factor categories.
   - Business templates are available and accessible.
2. **`.clinerules` Update (MUP):**
   ```
   last_action: "Completed Set-up/Maintenance Phase"
   current_phase: "Set-up/Maintenance"
   next_action: "Phase Complete - User Action Required"
   next_phase: "Strategy"
   ```
3. **User Action**: After updating `.clinerules`, pause for user to trigger the next session (e.g., reset context in VS Code). See Core System Prompt, Section III for a phase transition checklist.

## II. Initializing Core Required Files

**Action**: Ensure all core files exist, creating them if missing as specified.

**Procedure:**
1. **Check for Existence**: Check if each file (`.clinerules`, `projectbrief.md`, `productContext.md`, `activeContext.md`, `business_dependency_tracker.md`, `changelog.md`, `progress.md`) exists.
2. **Create Missing Files:**
   - For `.clinerules`: Use `write_to_file` to create with minimal content:
     ```
     [LAST_ACTION_STATE]
     last_action: "System Initialized"
     current_phase: "Set-up/Maintenance"
     next_action: "Initialize Core Files"
     next_phase: "Set-up/Maintenance"

     # Business Innovation Dependency Tracker

     ## Overview
     This tracker documents dependencies between various business innovation factors within the BRCT framework. Unlike code dependencies, business dependencies represent relationships between market factors, organizational capabilities, customer needs, and other business elements that influence innovation outcomes.

     ## Dependency Types and Symbols

     | Symbol | Type | Description |
     |--------|------|-------------|
     | `M` | Market | Dependency on market conditions or customer factors |
     | `O` | Organizational | Dependency on internal capabilities or resources |
     | `T` | Technological | Dependency on technological factors or capabilities |
     | `F` | Financial | Dependency on funding, investment, or financial metrics |
     | `R` | Regulatory | Dependency on legal or regulatory factors |
     | `C` | Competitive | Dependency on competitor actions or positioning |
     | `S` | Strategic | Dependency on strategic decisions or direction |
     | `<` | Input | The row depends on the column as an input |
     | `>` | Output | The column depends on the row as an input |
     | `x` | Bidirectional | Mutual dependency between factors |
     | `o` | Self | No dependency (diagonal only) |
     | `n` | None | Verified no dependency |
     | `p` | Placeholder | Unverified potential dependency |

     ## Business Factor Categories

     ### Market Factors
     - Customer needs and preferences

     ```
3. **Check Business Templates**: Verify that the following templates exist in `src/business_templates/`:
   - `idea_generation_template.md`
   - `idea_evaluation_template.md`
   - `business_model_canvas.md`
   - `swot_analysis_template.md`
   - `market_research_template.md`
   - `README.md`
4. **MUP**: Follow Core Prompt MUP after creating files.

## III. Business Factor Definition and Categorization

**Objective**: Define and categorize the key business factors that will be tracked in the business_dependency_tracker.md.

**Procedure:**
1. **Review Initial Categories**: Verify the business factor categories in `business_dependency_tracker.md`:
   - Market Factors
   - Organizational Factors
   - Product/Service Factors
   - Financial Factors
   - Strategic Factors
2. **Refine Categories as Needed**: Based on the specific business context of the project, add or modify categories to better match the project's needs.
3. **Define Specific Factors**: For each category, define the specific factors that will be tracked. For example:
   - Market Factors: Customer segments, market size, competitors, etc.
   - Organizational Factors: Team structure, resource availability, etc.
4. **Document in `business_dependency_tracker.md`**: Update the file with the refined categories and specific factors.
5. **MUP**: Apply Core MUP after updating the file.

---

## IV. Defining Business Dependencies

**Objective**: Establish clear relationships between business factors in the business_dependency_tracker.md.

**Procedure:**
1. **Review Current Grid**: Examine the grid structure in `business_dependency_tracker.md` to understand the current relationships between factors.
2. **Identify Dependencies**: For each business factor, analyze its relationships with other factors:
   - What other factors does it depend on?
   - What other factors depend on it?
   - Are there any mutual dependencies?
3. **Update the Grid**:
   - For each identified dependency, replace the placeholder 'p' with the appropriate dependency character (M, O, T, F, R, C, S) followed by the relationship character (<, >, x).
   - For example, 'M<' indicates a market dependency where the row depends on the column.
4. **Document Reasoning**:
   - For each update, document the rationale in the "Dependencies Notes" section of the file.
   - Explain why the dependency exists and how it affects the business innovation process.
5. **MUP**: Apply Core MUP after updating the file.

---

## V. Business Innovation Templates Review

**Objective**: Ensure that business innovation templates are available and appropriate for the project's needs.

**Procedure:**
1. **Review Template Content**: Examine each template in `src/business_templates/` to ensure it includes:
   - Clear instructions for use
   - Relevant sections for the business innovation process
   - Integration with the BRCT framework principles
   - Chain-of-thought documentation sections
2. **Customize if Needed**: If the templates need adjustments for the specific project:
   - Create copies with modifications
   - Update them to reflect project-specific terminology or processes
   - Add additional sections if required
3. **Document Templates**: Update `activeContext.md` with information about available templates and how they should be used in the project.
4. **MUP**: Apply Core MUP after any template modifications.

---

## VI. Set-up/Maintenance Plugin - MUP Additions

After Core MUP steps:
1. **Update `business_dependency_tracker.md`**: Save changes to factor definitions and dependencies.
2. **Update Business Templates**: If modified, save changes to templates.
3. **Update `.clinerules` [LAST_ACTION_STATE]:**

    - Example after initialization:

    ```
    [LAST_ACTION_STATE]
    last_action: "Initialized Core Files"
    current_phase: "Set-up/Maintenance"
    next_action: "Define Business Factors"
    next_phase: "Set-up/Maintenance"

    [CODE_ROOT_DIRECTORIES]
    - src

    [LEARNING_JOURNAL]
    ```

    - Example after completing setup:

    ```
    [LAST_ACTION_STATE]
    last_action: "Completed Set-up/Maintenance Phase"
    current_phase: "Set-up/Maintenance"
    next_action: "Phase Complete - User Action Required"
    next_phase: "Strategy"
