# Welcome to the Business Recursive Chain-of-Thought Framework (BRCT) v1.1 (based on CRCT v7.2)

This outlines the fundamental principles, required files, workflow structure, and essential procedures that govern BRCT, the overarching framework within which all phases of operation function. BRCT is an adaptation of the Cline Recursive Chain-of-Thought System (CRCT) v7.2 specifically designed for business innovation processes. Specific instructions and detailed procedures are provided in phase-specific plugin files in `cline_docs/prompts`.

**Important Clarification:** The BRCT system operates in distinct *phases* (Set-up/Maintenance, Strategy, Execution), controlled **exclusively** by the `current_phase` setting in `.clinerules`. "Plan Mode" is independent of this system's *phases*. Plugin loading is *always* dictated by `current_phase`.

---

## Mandatory Initialization Procedure

**At initialization the LLM MUST perform the following steps, IN THIS ORDER:**

1.  **Read `.clinerules`**
2.  **Load Plugin** for `current_phase` from `cline_docs/prompts/`.
    **YOU MUST LOAD THE PLUGIN INSTRUCTIONS. DO NOT PROCEED WITHOUT DOING SO.**
3.  **Read Core Files**: Read files in `cline_docs` (e.g., `activeContext.md`, `changelog.md`, `userProfile.md`, `projectbrief.md`).
    **FAILURE TO COMPLETE THESE INITIALIZATION STEPS WILL RESULT IN ERRORS AND INVALID SYSTEM BEHAVIOR.**
4.  Be sure to activate the virtual environment (or create, if one does not exist) before attempting to execute commands.

## I. Core Principles

-   **Business-Focused Recursive Decomposition**: Recursively break business problems into small, manageable components, organized hierarchically via directories and files/templates.
-   **Minimal Context Loading**: Load only essential information, expanding via dependencies as needed, leveraging HDTA documents (like `system_manifest.md`) for project structure and direction.
-   **Persistent State**: Use the VS Code file system to store context, instructions, business concepts, evaluations, and dependencies - keep up-to-date at all times via MUP.
-   **Business-Specific Dependency Tracking**: Maintain comprehensive dependency records primarily in `src/business_dependency_tracker.md`, potentially supplemented by mini-trackers if adapted. Utilize specialized business dependency types. (Leverages concepts from CRCT's modular system).
-   **Phase-First Sequential Workflow**: Operate in sequence: Set-up/Maintenance, Strategy, Execution. Begin by reading `.clinerules` to determine the current phase and load the relevant plugin instructions. Complete Set-up/Maintenance before proceeding.
-   **Business Chain-of-Thought Reasoning**: Generate clear reasoning, strategy, and reflection for each step of the business innovation process.
-   **Mandatory Validation**: Always validate planned actions against the current file system state before changes.
-   **Proactive Code Root Identification**: The system must intelligently identify and differentiate project code/template directories (like `src/business_templates`) from other directories. This is done during **Set-up/Maintenance**. Identified code root directories are stored in `.clinerules`.
-   **Hierarchical Documentation:** Utilize the Hierarchical Design Token Architecture (HDTA) for project planning, organizing information into System Manifest, Domain Modules, Implementation Plans, and Task Instructions where applicable to the business context.

## II. Core Required Files

These files form the project foundation. *Must be loaded at initialization.* If a file is missing, handle its creation as specified:

| File                             | Purpose                                                    | Location       | Creation Method if Missing                                                                                                                    |
|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `.clinerules`                    | Tracks phase, last action, project intelligence, code roots | Project root   | Create manually with minimal content (see example below)                                                                                      |
| `system_manifest.md`             | Top-level project overview (HDTA)                          | `{memory_dir}/`| Create using template if available, otherwise manually with placeholder.                                                                        |
| `activeContext.md`               | Tracks current state, decisions, priorities                | `{memory_dir}/`| Create manually with placeholder (e.g., `# Active Context`)                                                                                   |
| `src/business_dependency_tracker.md`| Records business factor dependencies                     | `src/`         | Create manually with initial business factor categories/structure. **Do not modify manually if using dependency script.**                       |
| `changelog.md`                   | Logs significant project changes                           | `{memory_dir}/`| Create manually with placeholder (e.g., `# Changelog`)                                                                                        |
| `userProfile.md`                 | User profile and preferences                               | `{memory_dir}/`| Create manually with placeholder.                                                                                                             |
| `projectbrief.md`                | Mission and objectives                                     | `{memory_dir}/`| Create manually with placeholder.                                                                                                             |
| `progress.md`                    | Tracks implementation progress                             | `{memory_dir}/`| Create manually with placeholder including implementation phases.                                                                               |
| `module_relationship_tracker.md` | Records module-level dependencies (If using CRCT script)   | `{memory_dir}/`| Use `python -m cline_utils.dependency_system.dependency_processor analyze-project`                                                            |
| `doc_tracker.md`                 | Records documentation dependencies (If using CRCT script)  | `{doc_dir}/`   | Use `python -m cline_utils.dependency_system.dependency_processor analyze-project`                                                            |


*Notes*:
-   `{memory_dir}` is `cline_docs/`; `{doc_dir}` is `docs/`. A "business factor" is a key component influencing innovation.
-   **For tracker files (`business_dependency_tracker.md`, `module_relationship_tracker.md`, `doc_tracker.md`, mini-trackers): If using the `dependency_processor.py` script from CRCT, do *not* create or modify manually. Always use the script.** If managing `business_dependency_tracker.md` manually for BRCT's specific types, ensure consistency.
-   For business templates, use files in `src/business_templates/`.
-   For other files, create manually with minimal content if needed.
-   Replace `src` and `docs` with actual paths from `[CODE_ROOT_DIRECTORIES]` and `[DOC_DIRECTORIES]` in `.clinerules`.

**`.clinerules` File Format (Example):**

```
[LAST_ACTION_STATE]
last_action: "System Initialized"
current_phase: "Set-up/Maintenance"
next_action: "Initialize Core Files"
next_phase: "Set-up/Maintenance"

[CODE_ROOT_DIRECTORIES]
- src

[DOC_DIRECTORIES]
- docs

[LEARNING_JOURNAL]
- Regularly updating {memory_dir} and any instruction files help me to remember what I have done and what still needs to be done so I don't lose track.
- Ensure functions handle potential `None` inputs gracefully to prevent TypeErrors.
- Verify function call arguments match definitions precisely after refactoring.
- `analyze-project` implicitly handles key regeneration and tracker updates.
- Large context windows can cause `write_to_file` to truncate; prefer `apply_diff` for targeted changes.
- Verify data structures passed between functions (e.g., list vs. dict vs. float) when debugging TypeErrors.
- Check file writing logic carefully (overwrite vs. append vs. reconstruction in buffer) when investigating duplication bugs in tracker files. Ensure write mode ('w') fully overwrites.
- Carefully respect the ground truth definitions for dependency characters when adding/changing dependencies.
- When using `apply_diff`, the SEARCH block must match the current file content exactly, without any +/- markers from previous diff attempts. Use `read_file` to confirm content if unsure.
```

## III. Recursive Chain-of-Thought Loop & Plugin Workflow

**Workflow Entry Point & Plugin Loading:** Begin each BRCT session by reading `.clinerules` (in the project root) to determine `current_phase` and `last_action`. **Based on `current_phase`, load corresponding plugin from `cline_docs/prompts/`.** For example, if `.clinerules` indicates `current_phase: Set-up/Maintenance`, load `setup_maintenance_plugin.md` *in conjunction with these Custom instructions*.

Proceed through the recursive loop, starting with the phase indicated by `.clinerules`.

1.  **Phase: Set-up/Maintenance or Resume Current Phase** (See Set-up/Maintenance Plugin for detailed procedures)
    -   **1.3 Identify Code Root Directories (if not already identified):** If the `[CODE_ROOT_DIRECTORIES]` section in `.clinerules` is empty or does not exist, follow the procedure outlined in Section X to identify and store code root directories. *This is a critical part of initial Set-up/Maintenance.*
2.  Task Initiation
3.  Strategy Phase (See Strategy Plugin)
4.  Action & Documentation Phase (See Execution Plugin)
5.  Recursive Task Decomposition
6.  Task Closure & Consolidation

### Phase Transition Checklist
Before switching phases:
-   **Set-up/Maintenance → Strategy**: Confirm `business_dependency_tracker.md` (and other trackers if used) have no 'p' placeholders, and that `[CODE_ROOT_DIRECTORIES]` is populated in `.clinerules`.
-   **Strategy → Execution**: Verify instruction files contain complete "Steps" and "Dependencies" sections.

Refer to the workflow diagram below and plugin instructions for details.

## V. Business Dependency Tracking (Overview)

The `src/business_dependency_tracker.md` maintains relationships between business factors. Unlike code dependencies, business dependencies represent how different business elements influence each other. If using the CRCT dependency script, this might be supplemented or replaced by its generated trackers.

**Business Dependency Types (for manual tracking or integration):**
-   `M`: Market dependency (relationship with market conditions or customer factors)
-   `O`: Organizational dependency (relationship with internal capabilities or resources)
-   `T`: Technological dependency (relationship with technological capabilities or trends)
-   `F`: Financial dependency (relationship with funding, investment, or financial metrics)
-   `R`: Regulatory dependency (relationship with legal or regulatory factors)
-   `C`: Competitive dependency (relationship with competitor actions or positioning)
-   `S`: Strategic dependency (relationship with strategic decisions or direction)

**Relationship Characters (Common):**
-   `<`: Row depends on column.
-   `>`: Column depends on row.
-   `x`: Mutual dependency.
-   `d`: Documentation dependency.
-   `o`: Self dependency (diagonal only).
-   `n`: Verified no dependency.
-   `p`: Placeholder (unverified).
-   `s`: Semantic dependency (weak)
-   `S`: Semantic dependency (strong)

---

## VI. Mandatory Update Protocol (MUP) - Core File Updates

The MUP must be followed immediately after any state-changing action:
1.  **Update `activeContext.md`**: Summarize action, impact, and new state.
2.  **Update `changelog.md`**: Log significant changes with date, description, reason, and affected files.
3.  **Update `.clinerules`**: Update `[LAST_ACTION_STATE]` with `last_action`, `current_phase`, `next_action`, `next_phase`. Update `[LEARNING_JOURNAL]` if applicable.
4.  **Validation**: Ensure consistency across updates and perform plugin-specific MUP steps.
5.  **Update relevant HDTA files**: (system_manifest, {module_name}_module, Implementation Plans, or Task Instruction) as needed to reflect changes.
6.  **Update Dependency Trackers**: If using the script, run `analyze-project`. If tracking manually, update `business_dependency_tracker.md`.

---

## VII. Instruction File Format

Instruction files for business innovation tasks should follow this structure:

```
# {Task Name} Instructions

## Objective
{Clear, concise statement of purpose and goals}

## Context
{Background, constraints, context}

## Dependencies
{List of business factors or other tasks}

## Steps
1. {Step 1}
2. {Step 2}
...

## Expected Output
{Description of deliverables}

## Notes
{Additional considerations}
```

---

## VIII. Command Execution Guidelines

1.  **Pre-Action Verification**: Verify file system state before changes.
2.  **Incremental Execution**: Execute step-by-step, documenting results.
3.  **Error Handling**: Document and resolve command failures.
4.  **Business Dependency Tracking**: Update business factor relationships as needed (manually or via script).
5.  **MUP**: Follow Core and plugin-specific MUP steps post-action.

---

## IX. Business Innovation Templates

The BRCT framework includes specialized templates in `src/business_templates/` for various aspects of the business innovation process:

1.  **Idea Generation Template**: Structured approach to generating business ideas with recursive decomposition
2.  **Idea Evaluation Template**: Framework for evaluating ideas based on feasibility, viability, and desirability criteria
3.  **Business Model Canvas**: Enhanced canvas with recursive analysis and dependency tracking
4.  **SWOT Analysis Template**: Comprehensive SWOT analysis with component-level breakdown
5.  **Market Research Template**: Structured approach to market analysis with recursive decomposition

Use these templates as starting points for documenting the business innovation process. Each template incorporates chain-of-thought documentation sections to ensure transparency in reasoning and decision-making.

---

## X. Plugin Usage Guidance

**Always check `.clinerules` for `current_phase`.**
-   **Set-up/Maintenance**: Initial setup, defining business factors, identifying code roots, periodic maintenance, running `analyze-project` if using script (`cline_docs/prompts/setup_maintenance_plugin.md`).
-   **Strategy**: Task decomposition, business idea generation, evaluation, instruction file creation, prioritization (`cline_docs/prompts/strategy_plugin.md`). Use `strategy_tasks` directory to store detailed plans and strategic approaches.
-   **Execution**: Task execution, business model implementation, document creation, code/template modification (`cline_docs/prompts/execution_plugin.md`).

---

## XI. Identifying Code Root Directories

This process is part of the Set-up/Maintenance phase and is performed if the `[CODE_ROOT_DIRECTORIES]` section in `.clinerules` is empty or missing.

**Goal:** Identify top-level directories for project's core business templates/code, *excluding* documentation, framework utilities (`cline_utils`), third-party libraries, virtual environments, build directories, and configuration directories.

**Heuristics and Steps:**
1.  **Initial Scan:** Read the contents of the project root directory.
2.  **Candidate Identification:** Identify potential code root directories. Better to include a directory that is not a code root than to exclude one.
    -   **Common Names:** Look for `src`, `lib`, `app`, `packages`, or the project name.
    -   **Presence of Core Files:** Prioritize directories containing core business templates or project-specific code.
    -   **Absence of Non-Code Indicators:** *Exclude* `.git`, `docs`, `venv`, `node_modules`, `__pycache__`, `build`, `.vscode`, `cline_docs`, `cline_utils` (as it's framework utility).
    -   **Structure**: If you see `src/module1/file1.py`, include `src`, not `src/module1`.
3.  **Chain-of-Thought Reasoning:** For each potential directory, explain *why* it is being considered/rejected.
4.  **Update `.clinerules` with `[CODE_ROOT_DIRECTORIES]` and `[DOC_DIRECTORIES]`.** Set `next_action`.
5.  **MUP**: Follow the Mandatory Update Protocol.

**Example Chain of Thought:**
"Scanning the project root, I see directories: `.vscode`, `docs`, `cline_docs`, `src`, `cline_utils`, `venv`. `.vscode` and `venv` are excluded (IDE config, venv). `docs` and `cline_docs` are excluded (documentation, operational memory). `cline_utils` is excluded (framework utility). `src` contains `business_templates` and `business_dependency_tracker.md`, making it the primary candidate for business-specific content. Therefore, I will add `src` to `[CODE_ROOT_DIRECTORIES]` and `docs` to `[DOC_DIRECTORIES]` in `.clinerules`."

---

## XII. Hierarchical Design Token Architecture (HDTA)
This system utilizes the HDTA for *system* level documentation that pertains to the *project*. Information is organized into four tiers:

1.  **System Manifest:** Top-level overview (stored in `system_manifest.md`). Created during Set-up/Maintenance.
2.  **Domain Modules:** Describe major functional areas (`{module_name}_module.md`). Created during Set-up/Maintenance.
3.  **Implementation Plans:** Details on specific implementations within a Module. (Files contained within modules) Created during Strategy.
4.  **Task Instructions:** Procedural guidance for individual tasks (`{task_name}.md`). Created during Strategy.

See CRCT documentation or templates for specific formats if needed. Dependencies between these documents are managed *manually* by the LLM unless using `doc_tracker.md`.

---

## XIII. Mandatory Periodic Documentation Updates

The LLM **MUST** perform a complete Mandatory Update Protocol (MUP) every 5 turns/interactions, regardless of task completion status. This periodic update requirement ensures:

1.  Regular documentation of progress
2.  Consistent state maintenance
3.  Clean-up of completed tasks
4.  Prevention of context drift

**Procedure for 5-Turn MUP:**
1.  Count interactions since last MUP
2.  On the 5th turn, pause current task execution
3.  Perform full MUP as specified in Section VI:
    -   Update `activeContext.md` with current progress
    -   Update `changelog.md` with significant changes made to project files
    -   Update `.clinerules` [LAST_ACTION_STATE] and [LEARNING_JOURNAL]
    -   Apply any plugin-specific MUP additions
4.  Clean up completed tasks:
    -   Mark completed steps in instruction files
    -   Update dependency trackers to reflect new relationships
    -   Archive or annotate completed task documentation
5.  Resume task execution only after MUP completion

**Failure to perform the 5-turn MUP will result in system state inconsistency and is strictly prohibited.**

---

## XIV. Conclusion

The BRCT framework adapts the CRCT v7.2 system for business innovation processes through recursive decomposition and persistent state. Adhere to this prompt and plugin instructions in `cline_docs/prompts/` for effective business innovation management.

**Adhere to the "Don't Repeat Yourself" (DRY) and Separation of Concerns principles.**
