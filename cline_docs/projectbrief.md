# Project Brief: LLM Web Interface Subscription Service

## Mission and Vision
To create the fastest, most responsive, and convenient web application for interacting with major cloud-based Large Language Models (LLMs).

## Business Model
Subscription-based service at $5 per month, which provides users with 1000 messages across multiple LLM providers.

## Main Objectives (MVP)
1. Enable users to run LLM queries for a monthly subscription fee
2. Provide a unified interface to select and chat directly with multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini initially)
3. Deliver fast time-to-first-token and streaming responses via direct API calls
4. Offer basic conversation history management (session-based for MVP)
5. Provide parameter control for advanced users
6. Ensure a seamless web application experience on both desktop and mobile browsers

## Key Business Domains
1. **AI Interface/Interaction**: Providing a unified front-end to various backend AI services
2. **Subscription Services**: Managing user accounts, payment processing, and usage quotas
3. **Web Application Development**: Creating responsive, browser-based interfaces for AI interaction

## Target Market
### Primary
- Developers, AI power users, content creators, and researchers who:
  - Use multiple LLMs frequently
  - Prioritize speed and efficiency
  - Value a polished and intuitive UI/UX
  - Want access to multiple models in one place

### Secondary
- Tech enthusiasts curious about exploring different AI models through one interface
- Non-technical users looking for an accessible way to try advanced AI models

## Business Innovation Goals
1. **Speed & Responsiveness**: Match or exceed the performance of highly optimized tools like t3.chat to minimize latency
2. **Unified Interface**: Solve the context-switching problem by bringing multiple LLM providers under one roof
3. **Pricing Accessibility**: Make multi-model access affordable through the subscription model
4. **Superior UX/UI**: Differentiate through an exceptionally well-designed user experience

## Success Metrics
1. User acquisition rate and conversion to paid subscriptions
2. User retention rate and subscription renewals
3. Average session duration and messages per user
4. Performance metrics (time-to-first-token, response streaming speed)
5. User satisfaction scores and feedback

## Timeline Considerations
[To be determined based on development resources and priorities]

## Strategic Considerations
1. Balancing subscription price point against backend API costs
2. Relationship management with LLM providers
3. Scaling infrastructure to maintain performance as user base grows
4. Feature prioritization based on user feedback and market trends
