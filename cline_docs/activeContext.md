# Active Context

## Current State
The project is now in the Execution phase after having completed the Strategy phase for the UnifiedLLM Hub - a subscription-based web application providing unified access to multiple LLM providers with optimized performance and superior user experience. We have transitioned from strategic planning to implementation, with the first deliverable (Technical Architecture Document) now completed.

## Recent Decisions
- Transitioned from Strategy phase to Execution phase
- Created comprehensive Technical Architecture Document as the first implementation deliverable
- Selected React for frontend and Node.js for backend implementation
- Designed adapter pattern for unified LLM provider integration
- Defined edge-based performance optimization architecture
- Established MongoDB as the primary database solution
- Planned phased implementation approach with 4 distinct phases

## Immediate Priorities
- Begin implementing the API Integration Architecture (Task 1 from Implementation Tasks)
- Set up development environment and project structure
- Create initial project repository with basic scaffolding
- Develop standardized API adapter pattern for multiple providers
- Implement secure API key management system
- Begin frontend interface development with React

## Completed Execution Deliverables
- Technical Architecture Document with detailed specifications for:
  - Component Architecture
  - API Integration Design
  - Performance Optimization Strategy
  - Data Models
  - Security Architecture
  - Deployment Strategy
  - Implementation Plan
  - Technology Stack

| Frontend Development | Technical Architecture | ðŸ”„ Ready to Start |
| Backend Development | Technical Architecture | ðŸ”„ Ready to Start |
| API Integration Layer | Technical Architecture | ðŸ”„ Next Priority |

## Key Technical Decisions
- Adapter pattern for standardized API integration across providers
- Edge computing architecture for performance optimization
- JWT-based authentication with OAuth options
- MongoDB for flexible document storage
- React frontend with Material UI or Tailwind CSS
- Node.js backend with Express or Next.js API routes
- Serverless deployment model for backend services
- Phased implementation approach with 14-week timeline

## Technical Risks and Mitigation Strategies
- API dependency: Implement adapter pattern with fallback mechanisms
- Performance challenges: Layered optimization approach with edge computing
- Scaling issues: Serverless architecture with horizontal scaling
- API key security: Server-side only access with encryption and rotation
- Cost management: Quota enforcement and usage monitoring

## Next Steps
- Update the progress.md file to reflect Technical Architecture completion
- Update the changelog.md with new Execution phase milestone
- Set up the development environment for implementation
- Begin implementation of the API Integration Architecture
- Develop frontend scaffolding with core React components
- Create data model schemas based on the Technical Architecture
